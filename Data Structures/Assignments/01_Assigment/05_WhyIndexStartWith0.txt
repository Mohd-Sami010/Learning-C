Why in C index of array start with 0

1. Pointer Arithmetic and Offsets:
In C array index starts from 0, because the index represents the memory offset not the actual position.
● Zero offset [0]: For the first element, its distance from memory address is 0. Therefore arr[0] points directly to base address.
● N-th Element: The second element is 1 position away from start ie base address. So, its index is 1.

2. Computational Efficiency:
Using 0-based indexing makes memory address calculations faster for the computer: 
● Calculation: Address = BaseAddress + (Index * SizeOfElement).
● One-Based Penalty: If indices started at 1, the compiler would need to perform an extra subtraction for every access: Address = BaseAddress + ((Index - 1) * SizeOfElement). For early low-level languages like C, avoiding this extra operation was critical for performance. 

3. Historical Precedent (BCPL):
C's design was heavily influenced by the language BCPL, which also used 0-based indexing. In BCPL, arrays were simply pointers, and the [] notation was just a convenient way to perform pointer arithmetic. When Dennis Ritchie created C, he maintained this "shorthand" to keep the language close to the machine hardware. 

4. Mathematical Elegance:
Computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra famously argued for 0-based indexing in his 1982 paper, "Why numbering should start at zero". He noted that: 
● Representing a range of \(N\) elements as 0 ≤ i < N is cleaner than 1 ≤ i < N + 1.
● It simplifies calculations for multi-dimensional arrays and modular arithmetic (e.g., circular buffers).
